**We urge you to read [our official statement](https://github.com/cycling99/robloxgroupabuser/blob/main/STATEMENT.md) before using our tool.**

This can rank ****2 thousand people**** before being ratelimited
(30 seconds of ranking)

> This is in the early stages and might not work as intended 

# REQUIRED
the modules will auto install if you dont have them
- **requests** module - `pip install requests`
- **colorama** module - `pip install colorama`
- Python - [https://python.org/downloads](https://python.org/downloads)

# HELP
- If you want to figure out how to get your .ROBLOSECURITY cookie, you need to install **EditThisCookie** browser extension.
- If a bunch of errors appear in the console close it out **IMMEDIATELY**
- Do not put MAX WORKERS too high or your device might crash.
  - For big groups **(100k+)** use 25-40 max workers, for smaller groups use 5-15.

If you would like, you can adjust the variable settings in the main.py **(RATE_LIMIT , ERROR_LIMIT)**
